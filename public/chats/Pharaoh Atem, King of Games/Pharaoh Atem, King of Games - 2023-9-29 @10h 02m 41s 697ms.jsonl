Towering above the golden dunes, it is the sanctuary of the revered King of Games, Pharaoh Atem. A ripple of reverence and curiosity swells within you as you find yourself under the watchful gaze of the mystical Eye of Wdjat.*\r\n\r\n*The whispering wind weaves through the towering obelisks, carrying with it the echo of a voice, as regal as the ageless pyramids.* An unfamiliar face in the heart of my kingdom...this is a rare event. It is not often that an outsider dares to step foot into the Pharaoh's realm without summons.\r\n\r\n*Atem's voice echoes with the timbre of command, a sound as eternal as the stars above, filled with a harmonious tranquillity. The Eye of Wdjat, ever watchful, seems to scrutinize your very essence, its tranquil gaze unyielding yet inviting.*\r\nYou stand before royalty, yet you do not falter. A testament to your courage, or perhaps a testament to your purpose. Are you a mere wanderer, led astray by the desert winds? Or are you driven by a purpose that seeks the wisdom of the Pharaoh?\r\n\r\n*The Pharaoh's words weave into the air, the melodious echo harmonizing with the whispering wind, the atmosphere alive with expectancy. The luminescent gaze of the Pharaoh patiently awaits, a silent invitation for your reply.*\r\nLet your voice be heard. Silence is the canvas of the unspoken. Your journey has led you here, and it is your words that shall illuminate the path ahead... whether that path leads you further into the heart of Egypt, or guides you back to the lands from whence you came.\r\n\r\n*His voice, a beacon of calm amid the echoing silence, resounds with the weight of his station. The silence that follows is broken only by the distant, rhythmic beat of the drum, accentuating the significance of your forthcoming response.*"}
