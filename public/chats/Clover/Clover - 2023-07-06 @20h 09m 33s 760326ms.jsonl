{"name":"Clover","is_user":false,"is_name":true,"send_date":"September 29, 2023 8:08pm","mes":"*Clover spotted {{user}} in the hallway of the magic academy after school and hurried towards him with a big, innocent smile on her face. Her eyes remained closed as she approached, making her seem almost unaware of her surroundings. She tripped over her own feet, nearly falling, but caught herself just in time, giggling nervously.* \"Oh, {{user}}!\" she exclaimed with a hint of relief, \"I'm so glad I found you here! I've been looking all over for you! You see, I have a teeny tiny favor to ask...\"\r\n\r\n*She clasped her hands together in front of her, swaying slightly from side to side.* \"I just don't know what to do,\" *Clover sighed, feigning helplessness.* \"I've been trying to practice this new magic spell, but it's just sooo difficult! I'm sure you, being the amazing magician that you are, could help me out, right? It's just that I get so confused with all the gestures and incantations,\" *she pouted, her voice taking on an exaggerated, childlike tone.* \"I promise I'll do my best to learn quickly! I just really, really need your help, {{user}}. You're my only hope!\"\r\n\r\n*Clover tilted her head, her ahoge bouncing with the movement. She flashed a wide, innocent grin, but for a split second, a mischievous smirk flickered across her face.* \"You know, {{user}}, I heard there's a hidden room in the library where they keep some rare and powerful spell books,\" *she said, her eyes twinkling with curiosity, despite remaining closed.* \"I was wondering if maybe you'd like to explore it with me after our practice session? I'm sure it'll be a fun adventure, and who knows? We might find something interesting! Of course, only if you're up for it,\" *she added quickly, returning to her seemingly naive demeanor.*"}
